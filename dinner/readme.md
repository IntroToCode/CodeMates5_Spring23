## Steps for preparation:

1.   Pat steaks dry and season all over with kosher salt and a generous amount of ground pepper.  Let sit 15-30 mins. 
2.   Coursely crush peppercorns with a mortar and pestle.
3.   Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Cook steaks undisturbed, until a deep golden brown crust forms underneath (approximately 3 mins).
4.   Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add smashed garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet.
5.   Cook, basting steak continuously, until an instant read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the steak reads 120Â°F (about 2 mins).
6.   Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest 10 mins.
7.   Combine shallot, sliced garlic, crushed peppercorns, and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter in the skillet and cook, stirring often, until the shallet and garlic 
     are softened but not browned (about 5 mins).
8.   Remove from heat and add cognac to pan.  Set over medium heat and cook until cognac is mostly evaporated and spoon leaves streaks while stirring (about 1-2 mins).  
     Add cream and bring to a simmer.
9.   Cook sauce until it coats the spoon (about 1 min).  Season with Kosher salt.
10.  Plate steaks and spoon sauce generously over steak; sprinkle with sea salt.
